A stream is a sequence of data chunks that you can read from or write to gradually instead of loading everything into memory at once.

Streams are built on top of Buffers.

Why use streams?

Handle large files without crashing memory.

Efficient data transfer over network or file system.

Essential for video, audio, and real-time processing.
